        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
        but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for their
        historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiserie, are made of a
        layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled
        and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet,
        in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
        flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
